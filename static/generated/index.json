    "prompt": "A modern editorial documentary photograph of a marketing manager in a bright, contemporary office, reviewing printed reports and notes at a clean desk. The manager, appearing focused and quietly confident, is surrounded by subtle hints of business growthâ€”such as hand-drawn upward trends on a small whiteboard in the background and celebratory plants on the windowsill. Natural daylight streams in, creating a warm, energetic atmosphere with controlled shadows and balanced, vibrant colors. The environment features Command Blue accents in clothing or decor, Solar Amber highlights in accessories, and Foundation Stone gray in the furniture. The composition uses generous negative space, a dynamic rule-of-thirds placement, and layers of foreground and background elements for narrative depth. The overall mood communicates professional confidence, satisfaction in achievement, and dynamic momentum, with no visible screens, text, or tech devices.",
